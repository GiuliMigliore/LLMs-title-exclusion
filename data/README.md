# The dataset
The dataset containing the titles and the human labels is a subset of a larger dataset from the [FORAS project] (https://asreview.nl/project/foras/). The dataset includes meta-data of papers potentially eligible for a systematic review on the trajectories of PTSD after traumatic events. The subset used for the current study consists of the records used for the two calibration sessions. Calibration Session 1 involved two screeners collaboratively reviewing 100 old records, 100 new records, and 100 randomly selected records, to refine the inclusion criteria. In Calibration Session 2, the same two screeners independently reviewed 100 old records, 100 new records, and 100 randomly selected records. During the second session, inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated, and any disagreements were discussed and resolved with the assistance of a third screener. The first batch of 300 records (Calibration set 1) is used to optimize the prompts and the second batch (Calibration set 2) is used for validation purposes. The dataset will be made public soon. Once available, the link will be provided in this section of the repository.

All the steps for the data preprocessing can be found in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook in the current folder.
