# Optimizing Research Paper Screening: The Application of LLM Prompt Engineering to Title Analysis
If you are engaged in tasks such as writing a systematic review or meta-analysis, it's crucial to conduct a detailed search for relevant documents to ensure a comprehensive overview. Developed at Utrecht University, ASReview provides tool that assists researchers during the paper screening phase. By looking at the titles and abstracts of the papers, ASReview identifies the most relevant records and discards the irrelevant ones for different projects.
The goal of my thesis project is to use prompt engineering to instruct Large Language Models (LLMs) to discard irrelevant research papers solely based on their titles.
