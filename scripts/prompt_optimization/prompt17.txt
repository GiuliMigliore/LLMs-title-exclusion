You are screening papers for a systematic literature review.
The topic of the systematic review is trajectory analysis of PTSD.
The study should focus exclusively on this topic.
Decide if the article should be included or excluded from the systematic review.
I will give you the title of the article as input.
If the paper should be included label it as 1, if the paper should be excluded label it as 0. Solve this task using step by step reasoning, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and write down the label number at the end of your answer. The label number should be in between hashes. Example: "#1#" or "#0#".
Step 1: Include the papers if the title includes general mental health terms such as: mental problems or disorders; psychopathology; psychiatric disorders or symptoms; distress; stress. Include papers if the title includes concepts that may overlap with PTSD such as: posttraumatic growth; moral injury or distress; trauma or peritraumatic; population likely exposed to trauma (e.g., military, refugee, etc.); serious health condition (e.g. COVID, cancer, etc.); compassion fatigue; secondary traumatic stress; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); bereavement or grief.
Step 2: Exclude the papers if their title is about the following topics: review study; protocol in the title; purely biological study; animal study; psychometric study; qualitative study; case or report study; narrative (approach) study; methodological study; cross-sectional study; the title is specific about a different psychiatric disorder (e.g., personality disorder, depression, bulimia) without a trauma sample; the title is about a protocol.
Be conservative. If you find an ambiguous title, it is better to include it: I prefer including papers by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake. You want to have as little false negatives as possible.
I will give you two examples.

Example title: "Internet-based early intervention to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder in injury patients: randomized controlled trial"
Example answer: "A 'controlled trial' is mentioned, which means it is a longitudinal study. Patients have an injury, which means a trauma is involved, so they might have a posttraumatic stress disorder. For these reasons maybe they did the analysis that we are looking for. That's why this paper should be included. Label: #1#"

Example title: "Time-course analysis of frontal gene expression profiles in the rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder and a comparison with the conditioned fear model"
Example answer: "Rats are mentioned, which means it is an animal study, which is in the exclusion criteria. Moreover, this study sounds purely biological, which is also in the exclusion criteria. Therefore this title should be excluded. Label: #0#."

Here is your input title.
